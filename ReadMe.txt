The AirWatcher project is developed for a government agency in charge of monitoring
air quality across a large territory. Sensors installed throughout the region collect
environmental data, stored in CSV files. The objective is to design a console-based
application that can analyze this data to:
- Detect malfunctioning or malicious sensors
- Compute and compare air quality levels
- Evaluate the impact of industrial air cleaners
- Manage and reward contributions from private individuals
- Ensure efficiency by measuring algorithm performance
